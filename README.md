# CS-305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
To put it briefly, Artemis Financial was requesting for help on the security of their program. I was to test, review, and implement security measures to prevent future vulnerabilities.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
My primary concern was to address any vulnerabilities and report my findings, my second task was to fix any vulnerabilities I found previously. The importance of practicving secure coding
will lessen possible uneccessary vulnerabilities. Software security is of extreme importance as user information and backend company information can be leaked causing unthinkable amounts of damage to
either the reputation and be extremely costly.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most difficult part of the vulnerability assessment was actually reading the assessment and learning to understand what each report was actually stating.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I was to implement a certificate for the website to ensure a stronger layer of security, and also address any false positives on any future vulnerability assessment.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Ensuring the code runs was the first step that I took, along with finding any possible security issues, and after finding possible vulnerabilities then addressing them it was imperitive that I double checked that
I didn't open the application to other vulnerabilities via a dependency check and specifically looking for any new vulnerabilities that might appear.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I came into this class with no knowledge of how to do any of the things asked of me. I will be taking all the lessons I learned into the future with me, though I may not use all of it personally, but just
having the peripheral knowledge of how to do any of this will be invaluable.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The first thing I would show is that I have the knowledge to run a vulnerability assessment and how to read said assessment, afterwards I would explain my knowledge on how to produce a cert and token to secure a website.
